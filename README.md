# 45-Assignment-of-Javascript

This repository contains all my JavaScript assignments.

1 . Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message should
be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”

2 . Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

3 . Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the
following, including the quotation marks:

Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”

4 . Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

5 . Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.

You should create four lines that look like this:

console.log(5 + 3)

6 . Favorite Number: Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

7 . Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

8 . Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise , but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

9 . Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

10 . Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
